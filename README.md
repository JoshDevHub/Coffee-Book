# Coffee Book

A social media clone app for people who love coffee.

## About

This was my submission as the final project in the [Ruby on Rails course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails) over at The Odin Project. It encompasses a ton of what I've come to know about Rails through my learning there, and I'll discuss its feature set below. So grab a hot cup and enjoy :coffee:

## Getting Started / How to Use

For running this app locally, I recommend having the following prerequisites:

```
Ruby >= 3.1.2
Rails >= 7.0.2
Bundler >= 2.2.32
PosgreSQL >= 12.12
libvips # for ActiveStorage
```

You can then clone this repo, `cd` into the project's root directory, and run the setup script with `bin/setup`. This will setup the database, load the schema, run `bundle install`, seed the database with dev environment data, install JS bundling with esbuild, and install CSS bundling with Tailwind.

After the setup script runs, you can run `bin/dev` to start the dev server. By default the site will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.
